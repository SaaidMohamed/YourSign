        <p>Independent and enigmatical, Aquarians are unique.
        There is no one quite like an Aquarius, and because each is so incredibly individual, it can be tough to describe them as a group.
        Aquarians don't like labels, and may shy away from any adjective—even the good ones you might bestow upon them.
        Aquarians believe in the nature of change and evolution, and even though they're a fixed sign, 
        they may not necessarily believe they are the "same" people they were when they were born.
        Relationship going nowhere? Find out why with a Psychic Love Reading.
        Aquarians have a strong sense of social justice and making the world a better place,
        and see themselves as just one link in an endless human chain.
        They are very concerned about others, not because of how others treat them or how they want others to treat them <a href="Aquarius.html"> Read More...</a> </p>`

        <p>Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, Pisces can be close to psychic.
        Pisces feel things deeply, and have incredibly strong gut reactions.
        A Pisces "knows" things from deep within, and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad.
        That doesn't mean a Pisces ignores the logical part of their brain, though. Deeply intelligent,
        Pisces have a profound respect for the power of the human mind. Is it a surprise that Albert Einstein was a Pisces?
        Pisces are sensitive, and get along well in small groups of people. Sometimes,
        a Pisces may feel like they have an internal and external self, and they may need to spend a lot of time solo to recalibrate those two halves of themselves.
        A Pisces is rarely lonely when they are by themselves, and have an active imagination. Creative,
        Pisces love spending time reading, exploring or creating art or music, and understanding their emotions through art <a href="Pisces.html"> Read More...</a></p>`

        Passionate and independent, Aries will never do something just because 
        everyone else is doing it—a Ram needs to be 100 percent committed to the task at hand. Competitive to the max,
        the best way to motivate an Aries is to turn something into a contest. Aries will put everything they have (and then some) into winning. Loyal,
        smart, and impulsive, they always have multiple projects on their mind, and won't be satisfied until their work, social life, 
        and personal lives line up exactly with the dream life they've envisioned.
